Execution order for a new bash prompt:

/etc/profile        always, and inclusively to other files
In interactive login shells, only the first of these is executed:
    ~/.bash_profile     if found, does not look for further files
    ~/.bash_login       if found, does not look for further files
    ~/.profile          if found, does not look for further files
In interactive non-login shells the following is executed:
    ~/.bashrc
Often, the login shell files will call .bashrc
